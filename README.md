# Zeplyn

Zeplyn makes package publishing quick and easy in one command (```zeplyn publish```) so you can **reiterate faster**

## Installation ðŸ“¥

```
pip install zeplyn
```

## Usage


### zeplyn publish ðŸš€


In order to use ```zeplyn publish```, your folder will have to look like that :

```

â”œâ”€â”€ Package Name
   â”œâ”€â”€ src (folder where there is the source code of your package)
        â”œâ”€â”€ main.py (file with the source code)
     
   â”œâ”€â”€ setup.py
   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
   
```

Then you need to go to your Package Name directory with you command prompt ```cd Package Name``` and type ```zeplyn publish``` : it will ask you for your PyPi infos and then it'll upload it! ðŸ¤—
